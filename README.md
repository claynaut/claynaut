## Hey, there! I'm J.S. ðŸ‘‹

Software engineer based in Southern California. Coding nearly 24/7 as my favorite pastime and preferred work to do. Always a thrill to explore unfamiliar tech stacks, build in fast-paced environments, and enter uncharted territories for innovative software.

Currently working at a stealth startup, pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science at UCR, and collaborating with a friend at [Fearless Mouse Studio](https://www.fearlessmouse.com/).
